# HTTP API Interface

The goal is to implement a restful-flavored API client that will return JSON documents containing recipe information.

More specifically, implement a Ruby class that will:

- accept a keyword search term
- forward the keyword search term according to the http://food2fork.com/about/api interface definition using the HTTParty API
- return the JSON document containing recipe information provided by http://food2fork.com/about/api
